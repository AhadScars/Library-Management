The Library Management System is a Java-based application designed to manage a library's book collection. It allows users to add, view, search, update, and delete books efficiently. Books are stored in a HashMap, with the book ID as the key and the Book object as the value, ensuring fast operations. The system handles user input via the console, using Java's Scanner class. This project showcases my understanding of object-oriented programming, CRUD operations, and data management in Java.
